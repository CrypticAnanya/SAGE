## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend:HTML and CSS
- Backend:Python
- Database:
- APIs:Openapi ai Groq
- Hosting:streamlit

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [ ] **Groq:** It is used for queries
- [ ] **Screenpipe:** Terminator is used for changing screens ,using it to write something in notepad or opening apps and processing some commands on that  

## ✨ Key Features

Groq quickly processes user requests with LLaMA models → understands the user's intent intelligently.

'Terminator' mode acts like a bridge between the AI and the desktop: it executes actual commands, opens apps, runs programs, etc., automatically based on the AI’s interpretation.

Users can talk or type simple natural language commands like:

"Open Excel"

"Start a Zoom call"

"Play music"

"Tell Time and date"

"Open Notepad and write the following"

"What's the weather like?"

"Open chrome and open Wikipedia"

SAGE figures it out and acts — no technical skills needed.
