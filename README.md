## 📌 Problem Statement

**Example:**  
**PS 5: Power Productivity with Screenpipe**

---

## 🎯 Objective

-People struggle to easily control and automate tasks on their computers.
-Business users could want to automate boring desktop actions easily, just by "talking" to their computer.
-Developers might want faster, voice-activated or smart AI-based ways to run scripts or automate tasks.

### Team Name:  
CONCAT CODERS

### Team Members:  
- Ananya Tandon
- Ayush Goel
- Mayank Bhagel
- Ira Suvedi


### Your Approach:  
We decided on the problem statement to make an AI-Powered desktop assistant to ease that tasks of a computer user.This problem statement was simple but not easy to achieve .We worked hard ,learned new technologies like Groq and Terminator and tried to achieve the objectibe.
API key not responding.Integration of Groq and Terminator in our project and fulfilling the objective of the problem statement that we used.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend:HTML and CSS
- Backend:Python
- APIs:Openapi ai Groq
- Hosting:streamlit

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [ ] **Groq:** It is used for queries
- [ ] **Screenpipe:** Terminator is used for changing screens,using it to write something in notepad or opening apps and processing some commands on that  

## ✨ Key Features

Groq quickly processes user requests with LLaMA models → understands the user's intent intelligently.

'Terminator' mode acts like a bridge between the AI and the desktop: it executes actual commands, opens apps, runs programs, etc., automatically based on the AI’s interpretation.

Users can talk or type simple natural language commands like:

"Open Excel"

"Play music"

"Tell Time and date"

"Open Notepad and write the following"

"What's the weather like?"

"Open chrome and open Wikipedia"

SAGE figures it out and acts — no technical skills needed.
